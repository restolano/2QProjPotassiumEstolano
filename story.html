			<h1>History</h1>
			In 2010, Becarios de Santo Tomas, the Sole Scholars Association of<br>
			the University of Santo Tomas, has a project entitled "Iskolars Ng<br>
			Mga Scholars" which was in its 5th year by that time. By reason of<br>
			the upcoming Quadricentennial year of the university, the organization<br>
			has decided to elevate their project and share it to different Thomasian<br>
			organizations until they have come up with "Iskolars Ng Mga Tomasino: 400 Scholars @ 400!"<br>
			proposal. The Office for Community Development(currently UST Simbahayan Community<br>
			Development Office) suggested for the revision of project title since the<br>
			feasibility of having 400 scholars is difficult to achieve. The project became "BUTIL"<br>
			which stands for Bonded University Towards Imbued Learning. BUTIL was inspired<br>
			from the 'Parable of the Seeds' in the Bible. On August 2010, BUTIL was<br>
			presented before the UST Office for Student Affairs(OSA) and they<br>
			adopted it as one of the four projects of USTbongrunong, a students' initiative<br>
			led by Central Student Council. Both became the primary partners<br>
			of Becarios de Santo Tomas for the BUTIL Scholarship Program Program.<br>
			Several months had been spent for preparations and meetings<br>
			until majority of commitments was finalized on January 2011.<br>
			The number of beneficiaries was determined after the number of commitments<br>
			has been finalized. Last academic year, the program officially commenced<br>
			through the ,signing of contracts done by the beneficiaries and sponsors.
